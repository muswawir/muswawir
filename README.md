## Hi there 👋

I'm a software developer, my works so far are collected under **Isaacling Research/Ninx Technology**, I build across a range of industries with a heavy dose of healthcare and education.

This is a guide to what I have worked on. Most of the applications I have built share the same infrastructure, so having `Common Lisp` and `Quicklisp` installed will be a great start for exploring them.
